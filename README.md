# ANNUAL-AVERAGE-DAILY-TRAFFIC-THROUGH-PYTHON

 Taken a csv file with traffic density data per road segment of a certain high way, measured in Annual average daily traffic (AADT). Now I want to visualize this data.

Since I have the locations (lat and lon) of the road segments, my idea is to create lines between these points and give it a color which relates to the AADT value. 
So suppose, road segments / lines with high AADT are marked red and low AADT are marked green.
